    <p>I am have been in US for past 12+ years now. I have come a long way doing my Master's, adjacent to CPT consulting, then initial OPT Job Struggles, layoffs from consulting client, and ended up with a full-time opportunity at JPMorgan Chase currently. Getting my first H1-B and then moving through the ups and downs of the H1-B visa and marriage curriculum. I have my H1-B maxed out and waiting for my PERM approval currently for nearly a year now.</p>
